Hi! My name is Olivia Pak and I am a 10th grader at Chatsworth High School. Something basic facts about me are that I like to read, sleep, play Roblox, and go shopping. I also like to play volleyball. My favorite book series is Throne of Glass, an epic fantasy genre. I absolutely love this series because of the engaging, unique plot and well-written characters, and the way the ending was written was so impactful. Usually book series after a while bore me but this one made me want to savor the series for as long as possible. I wish that I could read it for the first time again. One of my favorite movie series is Harry Potter, it has been for a while so it is my comfort movie, ever since I finished reading the books in elementary One of my favorite TV series is a Korean drama called Reply 1988. I love the nostalgic feel of the movie and how although it is a bit slow, it is still so entertaining as it follows the lives of teenagers that are childhood friends and how they go through life together. Another fun fact about me is that my favorite musical artist is Clairo. I love how her music is usually soft and calm but at the same time very catchy.

Over the summer, I went on my second trip ever to South Korea. I went for the entirety of June and I wish that I could go back. It was one of the most memorable trips that I have ever went on, and it was so fun being able to walk around the different food places and shops. We first visited Seoul, a big city bustling with life. We met up with family before departing on our own adventures. After being in Seoul for a week, we traveled to a beach city known as Busan, where the weather was a bit cooler and the food was made up of mostly seafood. Although I liked the cooler weather, I didn’t like how much it rained, as most of our activities included walking around outside. It didn’t help that it was also so windy, so umbrellas did not help much. Lastly, we went to a more traditional and cultural area known as Gyeong-ju. Here, we visited many temples and hanoks, or Korean traditional houses. It was a huge difference from Busan and Seoul. Here, it was quieter and more serene, less buildings and more nature. I hope that I can go back to Korea in the near future.

Some goals for this school year include maintaining all A’s while also gettings 5s on my AP exams, since I am taking multiple this year and hope to make the most out of it. I also hope to meet new friends and join clubs that relate more to my interests rather than what I feel like I’m obligated to do. I also hope to read more books for pleasure this year, because I feel like I haven’t been reading as much lately. Lastly, I hope to stay productive and on top of my school work this year, and to not procrastinate as much as I did last year.
